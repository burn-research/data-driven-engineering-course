Materials for the data-driven engineering course at ULB.

## Resources to help you with Python:

- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

## Exercises:

- [Principal component analysis (PCA)](PCA/)
- [Data clustering and local PCA](clustering-and-local-PCA/)
- [Least-Squares, Lasso, Ridge, PCR regression](LS-Lasso-Ridge-PCR/)

## Term project assignments:

- [Modal analysis of a dynamical system using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)](assignments/modal-analysis)
- [Polynomial regression using different linear regression techniques](assignments/regression)
- [Dimensionality reduction and data visualization using t-SNE](assignments/t-SNE)

## Project rules

The objective of the case study is for you to get familiar with some of the techniques presented in class and maybe to discover other ones for a problem of interest. The case study should be calibrated not to exceed 30 hours of personal work per student (for a group of 3 students, 90 hours).

What to do in practice.


* Think ahead of a problem you would like to tackle. To get some ideas, have a look at some public domain databases at the following links;

  * [the wind power](https://www.thewindpower.net/index.php)
  * [open power system data](https://open-power-system-data.org)
  * [air pollution](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/explore-air-pollution-data)
  * [airfoiltools](http://airfoiltools.com/search/index?m%5Bgrp%5D=naca4d&m%5Bsort%5D=1)
  * [eurostat waste](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/waste/data/database)
  * [nist aerodynamic database](https://www.nist.gov/el/materials-and-structural-systems-division-73100/nist-aerodynamic-database)
  * [wind tunnel dataset](https://mi-pub.cen.uni-hamburg.de/index.php?id=433)
  * [turbulence](http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu)
  * [combustion1](https://tnfworkshop.org)
  * [combustion2](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/cet/isfworkshop/)
  * [miscellaneous1](https://blog.superannotate.com/public-datasets-for-machine-learning/?utm_term=&utm_campaign=Annotation_Search_New_Segmented&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=7527629942&hsa_cam=14073003037&hsa_grp=128022413461&hsa_ad=569775348928&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=dsa-392284169515&hsa_kw=&hsa_mt=&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjw_tWRBhAwEiwALxFPoQvcjuxfOZiVg8rQC-EnFQz7SeIwnqD_-KIMfDUxkvDw1LL46uIMxBoC5zgQAvD_BwE)
  * [miscellaneous2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)


The databases above are sometimes specific (air pollution, power systems, flows, flames, wind power, …) sometimes extremely broad. In particular, Superannotate and Kaggle include various databases from various engineering fields, tackling societal challenges.


* Get in touch with the reference professor from your section (Axel Coussement for Aeronautics, Emanuele Garone for Robotics, Alessandro Parente for Energy, Alassane Balle Ndiaye for Logistics and Transport, Omar Hegazy for Vehicle and Technology) to validate your idea or to obtain a predefined case study. The professors have/are preparing assignments for you. I will upload the ones available on the UV as the different Sections responsible provide them.

* You should have a case study defined one week after the break by Sunday, April 24th. The project's title shall be mentioned on the google sheet with the group composition.

* The case study could have very specific or rather broad objectives. You are expected to tie your analysis to one or more concepts introduced in the theory classes, e.g., discover patterns in the data, reduce dimensionality, identify the controlling features, and develop a predictive model for the specific variable(s) of interest.

* You can develop your case study using the platform you prefer (Matlab, python, …).

* The written presentation of your work (not exceeding 6000 words, including abstract and reference list) will be submitted to your supervisor one week before the end of the courses, on June 12th before midnight. Later submission will be sanctioned by one exam point.

* On the day of the oral exam, the group will provide a short 10 minutes presentation, followed by a 20’ minutes discussion.
