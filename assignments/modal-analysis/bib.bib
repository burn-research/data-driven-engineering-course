abstract = {A new formulation of the immersed boundary method with a structure algebraically identical to the traditional fractional step method is presented for incompressible flow over bodies with prescribed surface motion. Like previous methods, a boundary force is applied at the immersed surface to satisfy the no-slip constraint. This extra constraint can be added to the incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations by introducing regularization and interpolation operators. The current method gives prominence to the role of the boundary force acting as a Lagrange multiplier to satisfy the no-slip condition. This role is analogous to the effect of pressure on the momentum equation to satisfy the divergence-free constraint. The current immersed boundary method removes slip and non-divergence-free components of the velocity field through a projection. The boundary force is determined implicitly without any constitutive relations allowing the present formulation to use larger CFL numbers compared to some past methods. Symmetry and positive-definiteness of the system are preserved such that the conjugate gradient method can be used to solve for the flow field. Examples show that the current formulation achieves second-order temporal accuracy and better than first-order spatial accuracy in L2-norms for one- and two-dimensional test problems. Results from two-dimensional simulations of flows over stationary and moving cylinders are in good agreement with those from previous experimental and numerical studies.}
